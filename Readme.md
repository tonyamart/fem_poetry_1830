### Case study on women's poetry in Russian

This repository comprises data and code for a short exploratory study on women's poetry of the 1830s.  

*Part 01* - Classification: data and code for a short SVM classifation experiment;  
*Part 02* - Features-based comparison: data and code for a feature-based comparison of 7 women's and 8 men's poetic styles; morphological and lexical features are summarised and projected on the 2-dim space to roughly estimare relations between authors.  
  
**Abstract**
As both computational approaches to gender and feminist scholarship in Russian literature are quite elaborated fields, this article aims to combine these two methodologies to explore formal features of women’s poetry of the 1830s. Two parts of the article are examining hypotheses from the two fields: on the one hand, the notion that simple lexical features (MFW) are enough to classify texts according to author’s gender; on the other hand, that number of morphological and thematic features are highly visible in women’s poetry. Obtained classification results show that limitations and regularity of poetic language of the 1830s might influence classifier performance, making women’s poetry very similar to the men’s one. At the same time, manually selected morphological and thematic features can give more interpretable results, yet disprove some critical opinions on common features of women’s poetry.
